# cpp-riemann-teamC

In this program, teamC members, Muhan Zhang and Xudong Zhuang, will use C++ language to calculate the following integral:
$$\int_a^b \frac{1}{x^2 + 1} dx$$
where we can change the value of a and b, i.e. the integral interval, to calculate the value of the integral. In our main function, we try to use a = 0, and b = 1 to test the function. In our integration function (calculate_integral), we use the Riemann sum method with number of points fixated at 1000.
